2D clone of the classic Air Xonix game in assembly language .Main goal of the game is to isolate as much are as possible.
Level 2 was supposed to have an additional enemy but after implementing the flood filling algorithm for the game it didnt seem that fun. Level 2 has increased enemy speed and a slight change in player model.
The game was made in collaboration with (http://github.com/hafizhammadahmed) and rafay.
